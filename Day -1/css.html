        <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a fundamental technology used to describe the presentation of web pages written in HTML or XML. It defines how HTML elements are displayed on screen, in print, or spoken aloud. By separating the content (HTML structure) from its presentation (CSS styling), CSS allows web designers and developers to create consistent and visually appealing layouts across different devices and screen sizes. Here’s how CSS works: Selectors: CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements that you want to style. Selectors can target elements based on their tag names (div, p, h1, etc.), classes (.classname), IDs (#idname), attributes ([type="text"]), or even their relationship with other elements (e.g., parent-child). Properties and Values: Once an element is selected, CSS rules specify how it should look or behave using properties and values. Properties like color, font-size, margin, padding, border, and background-color control various aspects of the element’s appearance. Values assigned to these properties determine specific settings (e.g., color: blue, font-size: 16px, margin: 10px). Cascade and Specificity: The term "cascading" in CSS refers to the process of combining multiple style sheets and resolving conflicts between conflicting rules. CSS rules also follow a specificity hierarchy, which determines which styles are applied when multiple rules target the same element. Inheritance: CSS properties can be inherited from parent elements to their child elements, allowing for consistent styling across related elements without explicitly specifying styles for each child. Media Queries: CSS includes media queries that allow you to apply different styles based on factors like screen size, device orientation, or print vs. screen display. This enables responsive design, where web pages adapt to different viewing contexts. Frameworks and Preprocessors: CSS frameworks like Bootstrap provide pre-written CSS styles and components, speeding up development. CSS preprocessors like Sass and Less extend CSS with features like variables, nesting, and functions, making stylesheets more maintainable and easier to write. Overall, CSS is essential for creating attractive and functional websites, enhancing user experience by making content readable, accessible, and visually appealing across various devices and platforms.</p>
